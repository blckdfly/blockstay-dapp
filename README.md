## Blockstay DApp

Blockstay DApp is a decentralized application designed to revolutionize the way we manage and verify property rentals using blockchain technology. This application leverages the transparency, security, and immutability of blockchain to create a trustless environment for both property owners and renters.

### Features

- **Smart Contracts**: Rental agreements are managed through smart contracts, automating the process and reducing the need for intermediaries.
- **Secure Payments**: Rent payments are handled through cryptocurrency transactions, providing a secure and fast payment method.
- **Verification System**: Both property owners and renters can be verified through a decentralized identity system, enhancing trust and reducing fraud.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The DApp offers an intuitive interface for users to easily navigate and manage their rental activities.

### Technologies Used

- **Blockchain**: [Fuel Network](https://fuel.network/) or other blockchain platforms for decentralized data storage and smart contract execution.
